# DownSlide
Simple presentation tool built with GitDown framework, utilizing GitHub's various services and Markdown for content formatting.

## What is Markdown?
Markdown is a simple language for plain text that practically eliminates the need for mouse interaction and makes it super easy to format content. Using common symbols like `#` and `-`, you can create neatly formatted documents with ease.

## Made for Simplicity
DownSlide is built to simplify the process of creating presentations. It attempts to automatically generate a sleek and usable presentation by parsing Markdown into slide sections.

## Configurable
As with other GitDown projects, DownSlide is fully themable/skinnable using CSS. There are also a bunch of pre-made themes to learn from or just use as needed. Moreover, the project is built for GitHub Pages. At no cost and with practically zero effort, the project can be copied(forked) into a web-ready website, hosted for free through GitHub.

## GitHub and GitHub Pages
GitHub is a developer focused code-hosting platform. GitHub Pages lets you host code for HTML websites at no cost. With that, you can host your own DownSlide driven website for free.
